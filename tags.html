    <p>HELLO MY NAME IS VARUN AND I WAS BORN ON THE 31st OF AUGUST 2004! BASICALLY I am A BIT OF AMBIVERT TYPE OF PERSON
        I LIKE TO BE MYSELF AND I MYSELF SEE AS A WANDERLUST BECAUSE I LOVE TRAVELLING BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT STARTED MY
        TRAVELLING JOURNEY YET HOPEFULLY IN NEAR FUTURE I LOVE BEING NICE TO PEOPLE MAKES ME FEEL MORE HAPPY AND CONFIDENT.<br>
        ENOUGH GIVING INTRO ABOUT ME AND ALL LET US GET INTO THE FUN PART IN THIS PHOTO YOU CAN SEE MY FRIEND KOUSHIK HERE
        HE'S TRYING TO CAPTURE MY REACTION WHERE A LOT OF TWISTS AND TURNS HAPPENED AT THAT MOMENT WHERE I DID NOT EXPECT WHAT
        IN THE HECK WAS HAPPENING THERE. 
    </p>
    <h2>KEY POINTS FOR BEING A GREAT PERSON AMONGST PEOPLE AROUND YOU ACCORDING TO ME!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS!
            <p>DO NOT HIDE ANYTHING INSIDE YOUR SELF YOU WILL FEEL BAD SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE YOU WANT TO YOU FEEL BETTER!!</p>
        </li>
        <li>DO NOT CREATE ANY EGO TOWARDS PEOPLE
            <p>EGO IS A VERY BAD NATURE FOR PEOPLE TO DEVELOP TO OTHER PEOPLE IT IS A WORST HABIT. IF YOU DONT FEEL
                LIKE TALKING TO THE PERSON SAY WE WILL TALK LATER AND TALK TO THAT PERSON WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK RATHER 
                FORCEFULLY STAYING THERE AND PRETEND TO LISTEN THIS MAKES THE OPPOSITE PERSON LOOK LIKE SHIT!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>BE YOURSELF!
            <p>BE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE RATHER NOT BEING THE OTHER FAKE YOU TO LOOK COOL AND TOP G THAT AINT GONNA
            LAST LONG MY FRIEND YOU LOOK CRAP +EVEN THOUGH YOUR REAL SELF IS BORING ATLEAST IT'S NOT FAKE SO CHEER UP!
